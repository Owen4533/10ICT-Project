    <h2>Hi, I'm Owen Nash. I attend Sacred Heart College and am currently in Year 10. I moved to SHC last year after previously attending St Heliers School.</h2>
    <h2>Before that, I lived in South Africa and moved to New Zealand about five years ago. In South Africa, I attended a private school called St John's, which was known for its academic excellence.</h2>
    <h2>Back there, I had two Jack Russell dogs who were super friendly but had a habit of running away and making us chase after them. Now I have two cats instead, and while they don't run away, they do love to fight and break things.</h2>
    <h2>I'm passionate about Water Polo and Swimming, and I proudly represent the College in both. My favourite part of these sports is the team spiritâ€”playing with friends and creating memories, especially when we travel for tournaments.</h2>
    <h2>Before committing to Water Polo and Swimming, I played a variety of sports, including Rugby, Tennis, Football, Cricket, and Golf. But in the end, my passion for Water Polo won out.</h2>
    <h2>In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, going to the beach, and playing Clash Royale with the boys.</h2>
