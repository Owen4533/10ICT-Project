    <h2>Hi, I'm Owen Nash, I attend Sacred Heart College. Currently I am a Year 10, and I only moved to SHC from St Heliers School last year.</h2>
    <h2>I recently (five years ago) moved from South Africa to New Zealand, there I attended a private school called 'St Johns', known for its academic excellence.</h2>
    <h2>In South Afirca I had two dogs, a breed of Jackrussels, who were very friendly but loved to run away, and make us find them. Now I have two cats, also from the same litter who love to fight and break things.</h2>
    <h2>I love to play Waterpolo and swimming, which I represent the College in both. My favourite part of the sport is playing with friends and memories, as we travel a lot for tournaments.</h2>
    <h2>Before committing to Waterpolo and Swimming, I loved to play a various amount of sports, this includes: Rugby, Tenis, Football, Cricket and Golf, all of which I dropped for my passion for Waterpolo.</h2>
    <h2>Things I enjoy doing include hanging out with friends, going to the beach and playing Clash Royale with the boys.</h2>
    <h2>If you click on one of the two buttons under my picture, it will take you to one of the Pillars our College Represent, and why I picked them.</h2>
