<h2>Support is about helping and encouraging others so everyone can reach their full potential. It creates trust, confidence, and a sense of belonging.</h2>

<h2>I chose the Support pillar from the values of a Marist man because I believe everyone needs support. The right support can inspire people, create lasting memories, and help everyone reach their full potential. Whether from family, friends, coaches, or teammates, it encourages us, guides us, and reminds us we don't have to face challenges alone.</h2>

<h2>Team Support:
In water polo I've learned how important support is, my teammates always have my back in the pool, and I try to do the same for them. That sense of trust helps me in and out of the game.</h2>

<h2>Family Support:
My family supports me by coming to my games and encouraging me, which motivates me to train hard and keep improving.</h2>

<h2>Coach Support:
My coaches support me by pushing me to be my best, giving me advice, and helping me stay disciplined.</h2>

<h2>
Playing water polo has shown me the power of support. My teammates and coaches encourage each other through every game and training session. During a tough tournament, their guidance and encouragement helped me stay focused and perform my best.</h2>
