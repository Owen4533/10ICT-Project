    <h2>Pride is about respecting yourself, your community, and your achievements. At Sacred Heart College, it means representing the school with dignity, giving your best in everything you do, and celebrating the success of others as well as your own.</h2>
    <h2>I have felt pride in my academic journey at Sacred Heart, especially when receiving two Academic Excellence Awards for Science and Social Studies. These achievements reminded me that hard work pays off and gave me confidence to keep striving for my best. They also showed me how pride is not just about personal success, but about representing my school and family with honour.</h2>
<h2>I have also experienced pride through sport. Winning Nationals and the Auckland League in water polo were achievements that showed the strength of teamwork and commitment.</h2>
<h2>In cross country, I proudly represent Sacred Heart at every event. Sometimes we finish last, and other times we place higher, but for me the pride comes from wearing the school colours and giving my best effort regardless of the result.</h2>
